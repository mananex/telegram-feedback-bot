# How the bot works?
**For convenience, I will divide the explanation into two parts - the user-side and the moderator-side.**
## User-side.
* ┏ Commands
* ┣  /start - *get start message.*
* ┣  /help - *get help message.*
* ┣  /ask - *ask a question.*
* ┣  /questions - *get a list of asked questions.*

### /ask
To send a question to moderators, you must first send the **/ask** command. If you change your mind about sending a message, you can click on the "*Cancel*" button at any time.
### /questions
To see the list of questions that you have asked the moderators, you can send the **/questions** command, after which the bot will respond to you with a message with inline-buttons (*if, of course, there are questions available*). 

When you click on the inline-button, the bot will send a response - showing your message and the answer to it.

The user also has the opportunity to delete asked questions by clicking on the inline-button "*Clear all*"
